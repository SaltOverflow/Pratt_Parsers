This is just me following along with the article https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-expression-parsing-made-easy/ and its corresponding github repo

We're making a parser for the Bantam programming language (which only contains expressions, no statements). This highlights the use of Pratt parsing.

Bantam programming language:
* Has prefix (+ - ~ !), postfix (!), infix (+ - * / ^), mixfix (?:) operators
* Has multiple precedence levels and left / right associative operators
* Has assignment, function calls, parentheses
